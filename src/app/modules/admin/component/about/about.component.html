    Healthcare administrators are in charge of hospital
     finances and advocate various strategies to improve their facilities and resources. Hospitals 
     provide funding for assets like marketing, charity events, equipment, medicine, payroll, etc. 
     At the same time, an institution should not be all things to people; it has its own limitations.
      The management administration carefully manages these funds due to a spending limitation. 
      The healthcare administrators control the expenditures that the hospital allows in order to meet 
      profits. Sometimes hospitals are limited on what they can do for patients. Administrators that run 
      these hospitals strive to achieve goals within their financial limitations. This study examines the 
      causes of healthcare employment growth and workforce composition in the US and evaluates the labor 
      market's impact on healthcare spending and health outcomes.[11] When healthcare spending reduces, 
      employment growth will start reducing as well. The healthcare administration is critical to the lives 
      of the people in hospitals. It contributes to cost saving practices and making sure that the 
      necessities are brought to the institution. Healthcare management makes sure that protocols and
       funds are properly organized for each department. They are responsible for keeping the healthcare
        industry afloat. Many hospitals host charity events and donate to them as well.

    Early hospital administrators were called patient
     directors or superintendents. At the time, many were nurses who had taken on administrative 
     responsibilities. Over half of the members of the American Hospital Association were graduate nurses 
     in 1916. Other superintendents were medical doctors, laymen and members of the clergy. In the United 
     States, the first degree granting program in the United States was established at Marquette University
      in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. By 1927, the first two students received their degrees. The original idea is 
      credited to Father Moulinier, associated with the Catholic Hospital Association.[12] The first modern 
      health systems management program was established in 1934 at the University of Chicago.[13] At the time, programs were completed in two years â€“ one year of formal graduate study and one year of practicing internship. In 1958, the Sloan program at Cornell University began offering a special program requiring two years of formal study,[14] which remains the dominant structure in the United States and Canada today (see also "Academic Preparation").

    Health systems management has been described 
    as a "hidden" health profession[15] because of the relatively low-profile role managers take in 
    health systems, in comparison to direct-care professions such as nursing and medicine. However the visibility of the management profession within healthcare has been rising in recent years, due largely to the widespread problems developed countries are having in balancing cost, access, and quality in their hospitals and health systems
